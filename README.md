One-to-Many Mapping Spring JPA/Hibernate

This project focuses on demonstrating one-to-many mapping using Spring JPA and Hibernate, which is a fundamental concept in object-relational mapping. The implementation showcases how a single entity can be associated with multiple related entities, reflecting real-world relationships such as a customer having multiple accounts or a department managing multiple employees. By leveraging Spring Boot, the project ensures seamless configuration, dependency management, and integration with the underlying database, while Hibernate handles the translation between Java objects and relational tables. The project emphasizes key features such as cascading operations, fetch types, and bidirectional relationships to provide a complete understanding of how data consistency and integrity are maintained. It also highlights how developers can use JPA annotations to define these mappings clearly, making the database structure intuitive and easier to manage. Designed as an educational and reference resource, this project offers a practical foundation for anyone looking to learn or apply one-to-many relationships in their Spring applications.
